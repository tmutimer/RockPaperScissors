# RockPaperScissors
A simple CLI rock-paper-scissors game implemented in Java in just a few hours.

The user can choose how many rounds to play at the beginning. Throughout, the game will remind the user of the score, and at the end it will show a play-by-play of the game.

My focus in this exercise was to embrace the object-oriented style as fully as possible, and within that, to ensure the code was encapsulated in the most logical way. Writing and reading from the command line was taken care of in the Main method, while all game mechanics were delegated to the Game and Round classes.
